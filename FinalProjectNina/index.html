<p>The University of Maryland, College Park is under scrutiny by students for recent sexual assault claims on campus being dismissed over the last academic year.</p>

<p>President Darryl Pines <a href= " https://dbknews.com/2021/10/15/umd-darryll-pines-comments-sexual-assault-college-campuses/">made a statement</a> dismissing recent allegations of sexual assault issues on campus made by students in the Fall 2022 semester. Pines acknowledged sexual assault by saying he didn’t feel there was “a big problem here in Greek life.”</p>

<p>This remark comes after years of sexual assault protests on campus by women advocating for change and acknowledgement on campus.</p>


<br>

<p>"I just think that someone of his position, no matter who it was, can't make a claim like that. It's affecting the students. And if the students are saying something's a problem, you can't dismiss that,” junior Kara Thompson said. </p>

<p>In an annual report released by the school, sexual misconduct cases are down 14% from 248 in the 2018-2019 school year to 213 for the 2019-2020 school year. </p>


<p>Students feel that sexual misconduct is still an issue on campus despite the report.</p>

<p> “While it's not necessarily directly reported like a lot of other statistics on campus would be, it's still spread out and I feel like from his position, he has to either believe the students or not believe the students,” said Thompson. </p>

<p>Karishma Ali, senior at the university, feels that expectations of women in society fuel these incidents. </p>

<p>The societal idealism of women and their place are what force the notion of how a woman should conduct themselves as a functional citizen is the focus of many of these ideas. </p>

<p> “The preconceived idea behind what a woman should be and what a man should be and this idea that a woman should be soft, a woman should downplay herself, a woman should be more submissive,” said Ali. “I feel like seeing that in societal structure I feel like that kind of plays into you know, people seeing women as capable to be leaders…UMD might be a little bit behind on that.” </p>

<p>The #MeToo movement, which began in 2006 is a foundation used for students at the university to speak out about these allegations. The #MeToo movement focuses on solidarity amongst those who have been assaulted. </p>

<p> “I'm all for the #MeToo movement. I feel like the basis and the core of that mission is just something that needs to happen,” said Ali. </p>

<p>The Prevent Sexual Assault (PSA) organization at the University of Maryland is a student-led group which advocates for sexual assault victims on campus and educates students on how to be safer, vigilant, and understand statistics. </p>

<p> Hailey Chaikin, president of the PSA, thinks more can be done for students among faculty and available resources amidst Pines’ remarks. </p>

<p> “So when he said that last semester, I felt like it was very diminishing to survivors, really belittling them, invalidating their experiences, especially because PSA has multiple survivors to him who have told them their stories,” Chalkin said. “Hearing something like that from some very powerful voices on campus is hard not to generalize all of the administration feeling that way.”</p>

<p>The administration allows PSA to protest and advocate on campus, as well as promote their own resources and campus resources to victims and students on campus, but these sources are not doing the best job according to Chaikin. 
</p>

<p>“Our Title IX office is, in my opinion, lacking a bit. We've had a turnover of the head of Title IX a few different times now in the last few years, so it's been a little bit hard to really get a grasp on who's really handling these cases.”</p>

<p>This is seen as a detriment to victims on campus and a lack of education on sexual assault on campus by students due to negligent faculty. </p>

<p> The sexual assault problem at the University of Maryland isn’t going away, and students continue to advocate for change on campus. </p>
